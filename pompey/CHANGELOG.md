# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- First stab at the full box: after Proton is up, fetch Seerr, the TV/movie/indexer engines, and qBittorrent-nox, then wire them on localhost.
- Ingress starts as a wait screen, then proxies the household search UI.
- Operator options for Plex and one source (URL plus key). No source catalog is shipped.
- Kid vs general folders from title certification (unknown → general).
- NAT-PMP mapped port is applied to the download engine.

## 0.1.1

- Named **Pompey** (the stack and the Home Assistant app).
- Seerr is the planned household UI; we do not reinvent it.
- No container image is published. Supervisor builds locally. Runtime downloads later; nothing extra is baked into the image.

## 0.1.0

- Clean start: search screen, Proton WireGuard, kill switch, NAT-PMP helper.
- Search is not connected yet.
